1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

- I spend 6-7 hrs in completing the Technical test. This time was utilised for the below:
   
   . Creating the test scripts using Selenium Webdriver with Java, TestNG and Maven
   
   . Creating a repository in Git
   
   . Uploading all articats to the location
   
   . Creating the Readme and Technical answers files

- I would like to add the below improvement to the code:
  
  . Test multiple test data (Eg: different postal codes) using external source files and capture the results.
  
  . Test the sort order of the results displayed.
  
  . Test the working of other UI elements in the screen.
  
  
2.	What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

I think the below areas will be given more importance in near future and will be emerging as interesting areas in the field of test automation:
- Increased usage of Multi experience platforms have lead to the need of levearging automation to new platforms like chat, wearable components etc.
- The emergence of DevOps concepts in testing.
- Introduction of Machine Learning and AI concepts in Automation testing.

3.	How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

The below approach should be feasible for automating legacy system.
- Automate only the most critical functionalities of the application.
- Automate the End to end scenarios which need more attention from the testers.
- Entire Legacy system should not be automated.
- I have automated few functionalities of the Legacy system (Customs Declaration system -DPP) while working in my previous organisation Dubai Customs.
  We had a business flow in the Legacy system (To create goods declartaion) which is the pre-requisite for testing any other functionalities in the system.
  I created a test automation framework for creating different types of goods declarations using Selenium scripts.
  Thereby, these scripts were used to run the regression testing whenever there was a new build was released.

4.	How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?

- While seraching with a particluar postal code, all entries which have exact match should be displayed first followed by the other items.
  Currently items are not sorted by default and some items which are not exact match are displayed at top.
- Performance of application is very poor. Search results takes more time to load.
- Loading UI can be displayed if more items have to be loaded and when there is delay.
  It will help user to understand that page is still loading.
